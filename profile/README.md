## Hi there!

SinkingYachts is a personal cybersecurity project focused on providing resources and services that improve safety across Discord.
Fighting back against scams, from phishing to malware! :smile:

At the moment, the project's only service is the anti-phishing API. I plan to launch more services and resources as the project grows.
In the meantime, check out the [website](https://sinking.yachts/) or [blog](https://sinking.yachts/blog) for cool cybersecurity resources,
or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cT6eQjWW8) to stay in touch!

The Vaccinator, another cool anti-malware project I'm involved with! <br>
